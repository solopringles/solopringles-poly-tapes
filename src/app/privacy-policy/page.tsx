                <p>
                    PolyLeviathan ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of our website and services (the "Service").
                </p>

                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>
                    We operate on a principle of data minimization. We do not require user registration, and therefore we **do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII)** such as your name, email address, or wallet address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information through standard web server logs, which may include your IP address, browser type, and pages visited. This information is used strictly for monitoring the performance and security of our Service.
                </p>

                <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
                <p>
                    The anonymous data we collect is used solely for the following purposes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the Service.</li>
                    <li>To monitor for security threats and prevent abuse.</li>
                    <li>To analyze usage trends to enhance the user experience.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not use tracking cookies for advertising or profiling purposes. The Next.js framework may use essential cookies for the basic functioning of the website.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>
                    Our Service interacts with the public Polymarket API to display market data. We do not share any user information with Polymarket. Your interactions with the Polymarket website via links from our Service are subject to Polymarket's own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                <p>
                    We implement reasonable security measures to maintain the safety of the anonymous data we collect. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
                </p>
