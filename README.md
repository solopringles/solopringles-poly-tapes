# Poly-Tape: The PolyLeviathans Frontend

This is the Next.js frontend for the PolyLeviathans project. It visualizes the trade data collected by our [backend Python bot](https://github.com/your-repo-link-here), creating a "tape" of market activity inspired by platforms like Dexscreener and Whale Alert.

## ‚ú® Tech Stack

## üèõÔ∏è MVP Architecture: The "Local First" Model

This MVP is designed to be developed and run locally on your machine. It works by reading from a **local copy** of the database that is generated by the live bot.

**This is the most important concept to understand:**

1.  **The Live Bot (on OCI)** is constantly writing trades to its own `polymarket_activity.db`. This is the "source of truth."
2.  **This Website Project** contains its own `polymarket_activity.db` inside the `/db` folder.
3.  To see the latest data on the website, you must **manually copy** the database from the OCI server to your local project folder.

This setup allows us to build and perfect the UI without needing to set up complex live APIs yet.
